# EOS-OSC

Firmware and Fader/Button Mappings for the LunarOSC Fader/Encoder Module

## Description

An OSC Controller with 5x Faders, 20x Assignable Keys, 2x Encoders and a 3.5in Touch Screen, and Cherry SPOS Programmable Keyboard support.
Designed as a sidecar programming wing to either be used next to a Laptop running ETC Nomad, or next to a SPOS Keyboard for more console-like control (using the https://Spurgers.Design/ layout)

## Getting Started

* Raylib (pyray)
* PythonOSC (pythonosc)
* A can-do attitude

### Installing
